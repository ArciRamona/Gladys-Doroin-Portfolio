          Building essentially a website that allows us to track all the
          countries that we've been to. If you want to know how many countries
          you've been to and which countries they are, you can get these
          scratchable world maps that you can put onto your wall where you
          scratch off each country as you visit them, I am going to use
          technology to build this. This is an app where we can enter a country
          that we've been to. And the great thing about this app is it's backed
          by our powerful Postgres database. We can enter some data into
          database, namely some countries. And the front-end will know which
          countries those are and display them in this beautiful way of
          visualizing all the countries we've been to. <br />
          <br />
          “This project is developed using a JavaScript-based full-stack
          environment, powered by Node.js for server-side functionality. Nodemon
          is utilized as a development tool to automatically restart the server
          on code changes, ensuring a streamlined development experience. The
          application’s user interface is dynamically generated with EJS
          (Embedded JavaScript Templates), integrating JavaScript logic into
          HTML for responsive, interactive views. On the data layer, a
          Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is employed to handle
          structured data storage and management, allowing for complex queries,
          data relationships, and transactions. This combination of technologies
          creates a cohesive environment for building scalable, data-driven web
          applications.”
