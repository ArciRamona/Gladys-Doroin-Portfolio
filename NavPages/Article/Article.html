          Hello! I’m Gladys, a dedicated Computer Science student, graphic
          designer, and software developer specializing in e-commerce websites.
          With a strong foundation in both the creative and technical sides of
          web development, I excel at building user-friendly, responsive
          websites that drive business growth. My expertise spans from brand
          development and web design to full-stack e-commerce solutions,
          ensuring that every project I work on is both visually compelling and
          functionally robust. Whether you need a stunning website or a scalable
          online store, I’m here to bring your vision to life. <br />
          <br />

          My journey began with a deep curiosity about how technology shapes our
          daily lives, which led me to pursue a career in computer science.Over
          time, I found myself drawn to the world of design and branding,
          realizing the power of visual storytelling and its potential to
          elevate digital solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          What I Do: <br />
          <br />
          • Branding: Crafting brand identities that resonate, balancing brand
          strategy with striking visual design. <br /><br />
          • Web Design: Developing responsive, user-friendly websites that are
          as functional as they are beautiful. I take pride in creating digital
          spaces that bring brands to life and enhance user engagement. <br />
          <br />
          • Graphic Design: Designing captivating visuals, from logos to
          marketing materials, that help brands stand out and connect with their
          audiences. I believe in a holistic approach, where creativity meets
          functionality. Whether it’s a sleek website, a compelling brand
          identity, or a memorable graphic, my goal is to build solutions that
          are not only visually appealing but also effective and aligned with
          each client’s unique vision.
